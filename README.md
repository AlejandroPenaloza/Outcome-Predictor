## Victory or Defeat!
> Our final output will simply indicate whether the home team outcome is a VICTORY or a DEFEAT.

By using data corresponding to Major League Baseball games from the dataset MLB Game Logs 1871-2016 in data.world,
(access data set [here](https://data.world/dataquest/mlb-game-logs))
so as data taken from baseball-reference.com by applying web scraping.

It was implemented data cleaning and visualization (analysis), and featured data engineering; to get the required dataset to work on and make the predictions.

This dataset was used to train a Machine Learning model and to test it, by using and comparing several classification algorithms such as logistic regression and k-neighbors.

The final ML model working with Logistic Regression gave important precission on these baseball games outcomes.
